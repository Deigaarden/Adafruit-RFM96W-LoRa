# Adafruit-RFM96W-LoRa

Transmitter and Reciever shields based on RFM96W LoRa modules.

Each shield is a protoshield consisting of the RFM96W with an associated LED, with a transmitting frequency of 433MHz. 
The transmitter protoshield is designed for an Arduino Uno and the Reciever for a Arduino Mega. 

Important: This is not compatible with the RFM69s
All radios are unique and can only talk to radios of the same part number. 
E.g. RFM69 900 MHz can only talk to RFM69 900 MHz, LoRa 433 MHz can only talk to LoRa 433 MHz, etc.

Specs of RFM96W
- Packet radio with ready-to-go Arduino libraries
- Uses the amateur or license-free ISM band (ITU "Europe" license-free ISM or ITU "American" amateur with limitations)
- Use a simple wire antenna or spot for uFL or SMA radio connector
- SX1276 LoRaÂ® based module with SPI interface
- +5 to +20 dBm up to 100 mW Power Output Capability (power output selectable in software)
- ~100mA peak during +20dBm transmit, ~30mA during active radio listening.
- Range of approx. 2Km, depending on obstructions, frequency, antenna and power outpu
